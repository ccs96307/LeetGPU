# Leaky ReLU


Implement a program that performs the leaky ReLU activation function on a vector of floating-point numbers. The leaky ReLU function is defined as:

$$
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
  x & \text{if } x > 0 \\
  \alpha x & \text{if } x \le 0
\end{cases}
$$

where $\alpha$ is a small positive constant (0.01 in this problem).

## Implementation Requirements

* External libraries are not permitted
* The `solve` function signature must remain unchanged
* The final result must be stored in vector `output`
* Use $\alpha = 0.01$ as the leaky coefficient

## Example 1:

Input: `x` = [1.0, -2.0, 3.0, -4.0]
Output: `y` = [1.0, -0.02, 3.0, -0.04]

## Example 2:

Input: `x` = [-1.5, 0.0, 2.5, -3.0]
Output: `y` = [-0.015, 0.0, 2.5, -0.03]

## Constraints

* 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100,000,000
* -1000.0 ≤ `input[i]` ≤ 1000.0
