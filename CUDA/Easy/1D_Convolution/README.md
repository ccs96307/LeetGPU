# 1D Convolution

Implement a program that performs a 1D convolution operation. Given an input array and a kernel (filter), compute the convolved output. The convolution should be performed with a “valid” boundary condition, meaning the kernel is only applied where it fully overlaps with the input.

The input consists of two arrays:
* `input`: A 1D array of 32-bit floating-point numbers.
* `kernel`: A 1D array of 32-bit floating-point numbers representing the convolution kernel.

The output should be written to the `output` array, which will have a size of `input_size - kernel_size + 1`.

The convolution operation is defined mathematically as:
$$
output[i] = \sum_{j=0}^{kernel\_size-1} input[i+j] \cdot kernel[j]
$$
where `i` ranges from 0 to `input_size - kernel_size`.

## Implementation Requirements

* Use only native features (external libraries are not permitted)
* The `solve` function signature must remain unchanged
* The final result must be stored in the array `output`

## Example 1:

Input: `input` = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], `kernel` = [1, 0, -1]
Output: [-2, -2, -2]

## Example 2:

Input: `input` = [2, 4, 6, 8], `kernel` = [0.5, 0.2]
Output: [1.8, 3.2, 4.6]

## Constraints

* 1 ≤ `input_size` ≤ 1,500,000
* 1 ≤ `kernel_size` ≤ 2047
* `kernel_size` ≤ `input_size`
