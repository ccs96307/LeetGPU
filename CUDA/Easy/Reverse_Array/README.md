# Reverse Array

Implement a program that reverses an array of 32-bit floating point numbers in-place. The program should perform an in-place reversal of input.

## Implementation Requirements
- Use only native features (external libraries are not permitted)
- The solve function signature must remain unchanged
- The final result must be stored back in input

## Example 1:
    Input: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
    Output: [4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0]

## Example 2:
    Input: [1.5, 2.5, 3.5]
    Output: [3.5, 2.5, 1.5]

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100,000,000
