# Softmax

**Medium**

Write a program that computes the softmax function for an array of 32-bit floating-point numbers on a GPU. The softmax function is defined as follows:

For an input array $x$ of length $n$, the softmax of $x$, denoted $\sigma(x)$, is an array of length $n$ where the $i$-th element is:
$$
\sigma(x)_i = \frac{e^{x_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} e^{x_j}}
$$

Your solution should handle potential overflow issues by using the “max trick”. Subtract the maximum value of the input array from each element before exponentiation.

## Implementation Requirements

* Use only native features (external libraries are not permitted)
* The `solve` function signature must remain unchanged
* The final result must be stored in the array `output`

## Example 1:

    Input: `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]`, N = 3
    Output: `[0.090, 0.244, 0.665]` (approximately)

## Example 2:

    Input: `[-10.0, -5.0, 0.0, 5.0, 10.0]`, N = 5
    Output: `[2.04e-09, 4.52e-07, 9.99e-01, 2.26e-02, 9.77e-01]` (approximately)
*(Note: The provided output for Example 2 appears to have some inconsistencies. The test data below uses the correctly calculated values.)*

## Constraints

* 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 500,000
