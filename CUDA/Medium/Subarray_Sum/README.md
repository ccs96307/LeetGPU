# Subarray Sum

**Medium**

Implement a program that computes the sum of a subarray of 32-bit integers. You are given an input array `input` of length `N`, and two indices `S` and `E`. `S` and `E` are inclusive, 0-based start and end indices — compute the sum of `input[S..E]`.

## Implementation Requirements
* Use only native features (external libraries are not permitted)
* The `solve` function signature must remain unchanged
* The final result must be stored in the `output` variable

## Example 1:

    Input: `input` = [1, 2, 1, 3, 4], `S` = 1, `E` = 3
    Output: `output` = 6

## Example 2:

    Input: `input` = [1, 2, 3, 4], `S` = 0, `E` = 3
    Output: `output` = 10

## Constraints
* 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100,000,000
* 1 ≤ `input[i]` ≤ 10
* 0 ≤ `S` ≤ `E` ≤ `N` - 1
