# Reduction

**Medium**

Write a CUDA program that performs parallel reduction on an array of 32-bit floating point numbers to compute their sum. The program should take an input array and produce a single output value containing the sum of all elements.

## Implementation Requirements
* Use only CUDA native features (external libraries are not permitted)
* The solve function signature must remain unchanged
* The final result must be stored in the output variable

## Example 1:
    Input: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0]
    Output: 36.0

## Example 2:
    Input: [-2.5, 1.5, -1.0, 2.0]
    Output: 0.0

## Constraints
* 1 ≤ N ≤ 100,000,000
* -1000.0 ≤ input[i] ≤ 1000.0
* The final sum will always fit within a 32-bit float
